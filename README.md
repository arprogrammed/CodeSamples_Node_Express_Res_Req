# Code Showcase 3

This repo is for displaying the things I have learned to code and concepts grasped for coding in Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, and using responses, requests, and NPM packages. Each file will contain comments that explain the code I used and my thinking behind it.

### Intro_To_Node

This small code snippet will render a random superhero or villian name in the console. *Uses JS, Node, NPM, and dependancies from the NPM manager package found in the Intro_To_Node file.*

**Desired output:** A randomly generated superhero or supervillian name in the console.

### my-express-server

A skeleton app that launches a locally hosted server using Express.js and routing to various pages that can be called in browser. *Uses Express.js and basic browser resp and req.*

**Desired output:** A locally hosted server that delivers the Express app through Port 3000 with basic routes.

### Calculator

This Calculator app has a basic numbers calculator and another calculator that determines BMI (body mass index) from user input and returns the results through an Express.js locally hosted server. *Uses Express, Node, NPM, JS, HTML, CSS, response, requests, functions, and logic.*

**Desired output:** A rendered and interactive webpage that allows the user to enter a height and weight, then return to them a page that will display a message with the results of their BMI calculation.

#### Markdown, Git CLI, and Github

This document also displays a basic understanding of Markdown. Additionally the repo was create on Github, but the versioning and remote push were all executed from the CMD line with Git.
